## Method 2: If User Doesn't Exist Yet

If ajfhr31@gmail.com hasn't registered in your app yet:

3. OR manually create a user document:

```json
{
  "uid": "generated-user-id",
  "name": "Admin User",
  "email": "ajfhr31@gmail.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "role": "super_admin",
  "assignedBy": "system",
  "roleAssignedAt": "2024-08-28T11:30:00Z",
  "kycStatus": "verified",
  "createdAt": "2024-08-28T11:30:00Z",
  "portfolio": [],
  "kycDocs": {
    "idProof": "",
    "addressProof": ""
  }
}
```

## Verification Steps

After assigning admin access:

### 1. Check in Firebase Console
- Verify the user document shows `role: "super_admin"`
- Confirm `assignedBy` and `roleAssignedAt` fields exist

### 2. Test in App
1. Have ajfhr31@gmail.com login to the app
2. They should see the **Admin Panel** card on main screen
3. Clicking it should open the admin interface
4. They should see all admin tabs (Dashboard, Users, Lots, Investments, Settings)

### 3. Admin Panel Access
Once logged in as admin, they can:
- âœ… View all users and their KYC status
- âœ… Approve/reject KYC documents  
- âœ… Manage parking lots
- âœ… View investments and payouts
- âœ… Assign admin roles to other users
- âœ… Access system settings

## Role Permissions

**Super Admin** (what you're assigning):
- ðŸ‘‘ Highest level access
- Can assign/remove admin roles
- Can manage all aspects of the system
- Cannot be removed if they're the last super admin

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Can't find user in Firebase Console
- **Solution**: User must register in the app first

**Problem**: Admin Panel not showing after login
- **Solution**: Check that `role` field is exactly `"super_admin"`

**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors
- **Solution**: Check Firebase security rules allow role updates

**Problem**: Fields not saving
- **Solution**: Make sure field names are exactly: `role`, `assignedBy`, `roleAssignedAt`

## Success Confirmation

âœ… **User document updated with admin role**  
âœ… **User can login and see Admin Panel**  
âœ… **Admin functions work correctly**  
âœ… **Can assign roles to other users**
